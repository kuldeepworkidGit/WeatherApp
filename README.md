This is a new [**React Native**](https://reactnative.dev) project, bootstrapped using [`@react-native-community/cli`](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli).

# Getting Started

> **Note**: Make sure you have completed the [Set Up Your Environment](https://reactnative.dev/docs/set-up-your-environment) guide before proceeding.

## Step 1: Start Metro

First, you will need to run **Metro**, the JavaScript build tool for React Native.

To start the Metro dev server, run the following command from the root of your React Native project:

```sh
# Using npm
npm start

# OR using Yarn
yarn start
```

## Step 2: Build and run your app

With Metro running, open a new terminal window/pane from the root of your React Native project, and use one of the following commands to build and run your Android or iOS app:

### Android

```sh
# Using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
```

### iOS

For iOS, remember to install CocoaPods dependencies (this only needs to be run on first clone or after updating native deps).

The first time you create a new project, run the Ruby bundler to install CocoaPods itself:

```sh
bundle install
```

Then, and every time you update your native dependencies, run:

```sh
bundle exec pod install
```

For more information, please visit [CocoaPods Getting Started guide](https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/getting-started.html).

```sh
# Using npm
npm run ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn ios
```

If everything is set up correctly, you should see your new app running in the Android Emulator, iOS Simulator, or your connected device.

This is one way to run your app — you can also build it directly from Android Studio or Xcode.

## Step 3: Modify your app

Now that you have successfully run the app, let's make changes!

Open `App.tsx` in your text editor of choice and make some changes. When you save, your app will automatically update and reflect these changes — this is powered by [Fast Refresh](https://reactnative.dev/docs/fast-refresh).

When you want to forcefully reload, for example to reset the state of your app, you can perform a full reload:

- **Android**: Press the <kbd>R</kbd> key twice or select **"Reload"** from the **Dev Menu**, accessed via <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (Windows/Linux) or <kbd>Cmd ⌘</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (macOS).
- **iOS**: Press <kbd>R</kbd> in iOS Simulator.

## Congratulations! :tada:

You've successfully run and modified your React Native App. :partying_face:

### Now what?

- If you want to add this new React Native code to an existing application, check out the [Integration guide](https://reactnative.dev/docs/integration-with-existing-apps).

# Why TypeScript?

This project uses **TypeScript** instead of plain JavaScript to ensure **type safety, better code maintainability, and improved developer experience**. TypeScript helps catch errors at compile time, enhances IntelliSense support, and makes the codebase more scalable. Key benefits include:

- **Static Typing**: Prevents runtime errors by detecting type mismatches during development.
- **Better Code Readability**: Helps developers understand data structures and function signatures easily.
- **Improved Developer Experience**: Provides enhanced autocompletion and documentation support in editors like VS Code.
- **Scalability**: Helps maintain a clean and well-structured codebase as the project grows.

# Troubleshooting

# Project Architecture

This project follows a **modular and scalable architecture** for better maintainability and separation of concerns. The key layers and their responsibilities are:

- **Components (`/Components`)**: Reusable UI elements such as `WAButton`, `WeatherCard`, and `Loader`.
- **Screens (`/Screens`)**: Page-level views like `HomeScreen.tsx` that manage layout and screen interactions.
- **Services (`/Utils/Services.ts`)**: Handles API requests (e.g., `getWeather()`).
- **Helpers (`/Utils/Helpers.ts`)**: Contains utility functions such as `checkWeatherNearMe()`.
- **State Management (`/Theme`)**: Uses **React Context API** for theme management (`ThemeContext.tsx`).
- **Async Storage (`@react-native-async-storage/async-storage`)**: Used to persist user preferences (e.g., last searched weather data).

This structure ensures a **clean, maintainable, and scalable** codebase, making it easier to add new features in the future.
